## 0. Materials

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05596)

- [Github](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed)

## 1. What is the paper about?

- Introduces **DeepSpeed-MoE**, an end-to-end software + model stack that slashes both **training cost (≈5 ×)** and **inference latency/price (up to 4.5 × / 9 ×)** for LLMs by replacing dense layers with **sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers**.

- Proposes **Pyramid-Residual MoE (PR-MoE)** – allocates more experts to deeper layers and fuses a fixed MLP "residual" with a gated expert to cut parameters ≈3 × without quality loss.

- Proposes **Mixture-of-Students (MoS)** – removes 12.5 % of expert depth and applies staged knowledge distillation to regain accuracy, shrinking size to 3.7 ×.

- Delivers a hierarchical, parallelism-coordinated inference engine (part of DeepSpeed-Inference) that keeps trillion-parameter MoE models under 25 ms latency on A100 clusters.

## 2. What is new compared to prior work?

- Brings MoE to autoregressive GPT-like models (most earlier MoE papers focused on encoder-decoder tasks) and reports 5 × compute savings at identical quality.

- First to combine **pyramid allocation + residual experts**, empirically proving that later layers need more experts (Phenomenon-I) and that "fixed MLP + one expert" matches Top-2 gating accuracy with less comms (Phenomenon-II).

- MoS with a **staged KD schedule** (KD (knowledge distillation) + CE (cross entropy loss) first, then only CE) that avoids late-stage under-fitting.

- Hierarchical + tensor-aware **All-to-All** and **expert-slicing**, which reduces comms complexity and enables super-linear throughput scaling.

## 3. What experiments were run to support the arguments in this paper?

- **Pre-training** seven GPT-style models (350 M→6.7 B dense; 13 B→52 B MoE; PR-MoE & MoS variants) on 300 B tokens with 128 × A100s. Compare validation loss + six zero-shot tasks (LAMBADA, PIQA, BoolQ, RACE-h, TriviaQA, WebQs).

- First-half vs. second-half MoE, Top-2 vs. Residual gating, Pyramid vs. Residual vs. PR-MoE ablations.

- Full-KD vs. staged-KD for MoS ablations.

- 52 B model on 8→64 GPUs; DeepSpeed achieves **super-linear throughput growth** (tokens / s / GPU rises) (Fig. 10).

- 107 B → 2 T models on 128/256 GPUs; DeepSpeed trims latency **5.5-7.3 × vs. PyTorch** and keeps ≤25 ms at 1 T. (Fig. 11)

- PR-MoE+MoS cuts GPU count in half (32 → 16) and latency by additional 20-25 % (Fig. 12–13). Also, 2.4 × faster & cheaper than 6.7 B dense at 52 B; 4.5 × faster & 9 × cheaper than 175 B dense at 1.5 T (Fig. 14–15).

## 4. What are the shortcomings/limitations of this paper?

- Evaluation focuses on language modelling; impact on other domains (vision, multimodal, RL) untested.

- Staged-KD hyper-parameters (KD stop step, temperature) tuned manually; lacks systematic study—may hamper reproducibility.

- Sparse-activation load imbalance is mitigated by expert parallelism but not fully eliminated

## 5. What is a reasonable next step to build upon this paper?

- Extend PR-MoE/MoS to **multimodal LLMs** (text-vision-audio) and study if residual-expert design still yields parameter savings.

- Automate staged-KD scheduling via curriculum or reinforcement learning to remove manual cut-off tuning and adapt to varying student capacities.

- Incorporate weight & activation **quantization** (e.g., 8-bit GPTQ) in PR-MoE experts to push inference onto consumer-grade GPUs while preserving sparsity benefits.

- Investigate **dynamic expert allocation conditioned** on sequence length or perplexity to further cut memory bandwidth during inference peaks.

## Appendix

- **Top-1 Gating**: A lightweight router that chooses the single highest-scoring expert for each token.

- **Top-2 Gating**: Sends each token to its best two experts, slightly improving quality but roughly doubling communication and compute.

- **Expert Parallelism (EP)**: Splits the set of experts across GPUs so each device hosts only a subset, lowering per-GPU memory and exploiting data locality.

- **Expert-Slicing**: Further divides the weights of a single expert across multiple GPUs (similar to tensor-slicing) when GPUs > experts to shave latency in ultra-large clusters.

- **Pyramid-MoE**: Allocates more experts to deeper layers than shallow layers, matching the observation that late layers benefit most from capacity.

- **Residual-MoE**: Uses a fixed dense MLP in parallel with one gated expert so the expert acts as an error-corrector, achieving Top-2 accuracy with Top-1 bandwidth.

- **Mixture-of-Students (MoS)**: A depth-reduced PR-MoE "student" model trained by staged knowledge distillation.

- **Staged KD Schedule**: A two-phase KD regime that enables KD early for stability, then disables it mid-training so the student can finish minimising its own loss without under-fitting.

- **KL Divergence (KL)**: A (non-symmetric) information-theoretic measure used in KD to minimise the distance between teacher and student output distributions.
