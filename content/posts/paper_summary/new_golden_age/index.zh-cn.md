## What is the paper about?

The paper explores the history, current challenges, and future opportunities in computer architecture.

It emphasizes the end of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, outlining how these phenomena affect processor performance improvements. The authors propose a **new golden age** driven by innovations like DSAs and open ISAs. They want to raise the abstraction level in hardware/software interfaces and focusing on energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness and security.

## What is new about this specific paper, compared to prior work?

This paper combines a historical perspective with forward-looking insights to redefine the trajectory of computer architecture. It introduces the concept of DSAs as a key solution to overcoming the limitations of general-purpose processors. The advocacy for open ISAs as a foundation for community-driven innovation is novel.

The holistic focus on security, cost, energy, and scalability distinguishes it from earlier works focusing predominantly on performance.

## What experiments were run to support the arguments in this paper?

The paper doesn't run the experiments, but it includes historical data on ISA evolution and market adoption, illustrating how RISC and x86 architectures succeeded in different eras. It references specific examples like Google's TPU for deep learning inference. Quantitative metrics such as energy efficiency and performance improvements (**eg, TPU being 29× faster and 80× more energy-efficient than CPUs for neural network tasks**) are highlighted.

## What are the shortcomings/limitations of this paper?

The paper provides limited experimental data and relies on qualitative arguments for its claims about future trends.

The focus on vertical integration might underestimate the complexity and cost of implementing such designs in diverse industries. Security improvements are discussed conceptually, but detailed solutions or implementations are lacking.

## What is a reasonable next step to build upon this paper?

Future work could focus on expanding experimental evaluations of DSAs across diverse application domains, which would provide more concrete evidence of their benefits. Addressing security in hardware/software co-design through real-world implementations and case studies would strengthen the argument.

Developing robust ecosystems for open ISAs, including compiler support and middleware, could accelerate adoption. Finally, exploring hybrid architectures that integrate DSAs and general-purpose processors seamlessly might bridge the gap between performance and flexibility.

## Appendix

RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer

CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer

Dennard Scaling (MOSFET scaling): As transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant, so that the power use stays in proportion with area; both voltage and current scale (downward) with length.

ILP: instruction level parallelism

DSA: domain specific architecture (eg. TPU)

ISA: instruction set architecture: An abstract model that generally defines how software controls the CPU in a computer or a family of computers. (eg: RISC-V)
