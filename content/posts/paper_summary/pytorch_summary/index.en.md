## Materials

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01703)

- [Github](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

## 1. What is the paper about?

![image](overview.png)

- Presents **PyTorch**, an **imperative**, **Pythonic**, **eager-execution** deep learning library that still delivers high performance on GPUs.

- Explains design principles (Pythonic, researcher-first, pragmatic performance, "worse-is-better") and the architecture that implements them (C++ core, async GPU execution, **caching allocator**, multiprocessing, reference counting, **AutoGrad**).

## 2. What is new about this specific paper, compared to prior work?

- Shows that dynamic programs "just Python code" can match the speed of static-graph systems while remaining easy to write, debug, and extend.

- **C++ (libtorch)** core with YAML-driven bindings; **multithreaded autograd** and ops that avoid the Python GIL.

- Asynchronous CUDA streams to overlap Python scheduling with GPU kernels.

- Per-stream **caching CUDA allocator** (reuse across iterations) that removes cudaMalloc/cudaFree bottlenecks.

## 3. What experiments were run to support the arguments in this paper?

- **Async dataflow profiling** (Fig. 1) to get near-full device utilization

- **Memory profiling** (Fig. 2) to show subsequent iterations speed up as the caching allocator reuses memory.

- **Throughput benchmarks** (Table 1) showing six models vs. CNTK, MXNet, TensorFlow, Chainer, PaddlePaddle. PyTorch is within ~17% of the fastest across tasks.

## 4. What are the shortcomings/limitations of this paper?

- Limited experiments shown for multi-GPU / multi-node scalability and E2E time-to-accuracy.

- No quantitative breakdown of how much each engineering piece (allocator, multiprocessing, async scheduling) contributes.

- Performance depends heavily on cuDNN/cuBLAS;

## 5. What is a reasonable next step to build upon this paper?

- Expand experiments to **distributed training** like rigorous scalability studies (intra-/inter-node), heterogeneous clusters, and communication primitives.

- Provide systematic **ablations** isolating the impact of allocator, async streams, multiprocessing, etc

- Automatic kernel fusion, graph-level optimizations, and seamless eager↔compiled transitions.

## Appendix

- **cuBLAS**: NVIDIA’s optimized BLAS library for fast linear-algebra routines on GPUs.
- **Pinned (page-locked) memory**: Host memory locked to speed up DMA transfers between CPU and GPU.
- **Copy-on-write**: Optimization that delays copying shared memory until a write occurs; avoided in PyTorch to prevent hidden costs.
